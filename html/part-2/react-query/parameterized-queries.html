        <h1>Parameterized Queries</h1>
        <h2>Topic im talking about</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">
          Now let's see how we can fetch hierarchy calls, or
          <em class="lite-yllw">nested resources</em>.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We want to create a dropdown list at the top that is populated with a
          list of users...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/user-list.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          Then when we select a user, we should only see the posts by that user.
        </h3>
        <h2>Select element</h2>
        <h4>Add this element to the PostList component...</h4>
        <img
          src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/select.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>ðŸ’¡ Notice that we are using bootstrap.</h3>
        <h4>Then wrap the jsx in a fragment...</h4>
        <img
          src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/frag.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h2>The users</h2>
        <h3 class="orng">
          In a real app we would render the users dynamically, but that is a
          distraction from what we are learning here.
        </h3>
        <h4>So we simply hard code some options for selecting users...</h4>
        <img
          src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/options.PNG "
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>We get this...</h4>
        <img
          src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/get-this.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="grn">
          Next we need a state var to keep track of the selected user.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          When the selected user changes, we should filter the posts by that
          user.
        </h3>
        <h2>Selected user state</h2>
        <h4>Start with a useState of type number...</h4>
        <img
          src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/uststate-number.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>Call it userId...</h4>
        <img
          src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/userid.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          Now we set the onChange of the select element to a funtion that takes
          in an event object...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/event.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          Then call setUserId and pass the value of the event target...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/event-target.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          <br />
          <br />
          ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¥We have a compilation error because the value attribute of the
          options is a string, but we had to set the type to a number.
          <br />
          <br />
          For fix, simply parseInt the value...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/parseint.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          We should also set the value of the select element to the userId so in
          the next render the correct option will be selected...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/value-of-select.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h2>Filtering the posts</h2>
        <h3 class="orng">
          In this component we are using our usePosts hook, and it currently
          dosn't have any parameters, but we should add the userId as a
          parameter so we can filter the posts by that user.
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/userid-param.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">Open the usePosts hook.</h3>
        <h4>Add userId as a parameter to it...</h4>
        <img
          src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/param.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>
          <em class="lite-yllw">OR</em> undefined, because initially it's
          unselected...
        </h4>
        <img
          src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/undefined.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h2>The keys</h2>
        <h3>So far we have only had simple keys with a single value.</h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          But now that we are dealing with hierarchial data we should structure
          our key a little differently.
          <br />
          <br />
          We should follow a hierarchial structure that represents the
          relationship between our objects.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We start with the top level object, followed by the userId, and the
          posts
          <img src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/" alt="" />
          This is the same pattern we use when designing urls for our apis.
          <br />
          <br />
          For example, if you wanted to create an api for fetching the posts by
          user you would use an endpoint like this...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/endpoint-comnt.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          We are following the same pattern in our key, as we go from left to
          right, the data gets more and more specific.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="red">
          Here's the thing...
          <br />
          <br />
          The userId is the parameter for this query.
          <br />
          <br />
          Everytime the value of the userId changes, React Query will fetch the
          posts from that user from the backend.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          This is very similar to the dependency array of the effect hook.
          <br />
          <br />
          Anytime any of the dependencies change, the effect hook gets
          re-executed.
          <br />
          <br />
          We learned about that
          <a
            href="/html/connecting-to-the-backend/effect-dependencies.html#Thesolutiontotheproblem"
            >(here)</a
          >
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We have the same concept here.
          <br />
          <br />
          Anytime the userId changes our query will get re-executed.
        </h3>
        <h2>Passing the userId to the backend</h2>
        <h3 class="red">
          Jsonplaceholder supports filtering by string, so we could do this...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/string-filter.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          ðŸ’©ðŸ‘Ž But this is ugly. Please don't do this.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          A nicer way is to pass an obj here...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/pass-an-obj.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          Here we set params to an obj...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/params-obj.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          In this object we add all the query string parameters...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/user-param.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h2>Test what we have</h2>
        <h3>
          Initially no user is selected, so select a user, and we will only see
          the posts by that user.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Let's look at the cache in devtools.
          <br />
          <br />
          Currently we have two items in the cache, user 2 posts, and the posts
          from all users...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/cache.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          User 2 was active, but when we select the empty option, all the posts
          are selected again...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/all-users.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          The key for all users is ugly with null in the middle.
          <br />
          <br />
          Let's fix that!
          <br />
          <br />
          When setting the key just write a condition...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/condition-for-key.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          That's much better...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/parameterized-queries/fixed-better.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h2 class="red">IMPORTANT NOTE</h2>
        <h3>
          Now, if we select a different user we see a loading indicator for a
          flash.
          <br />
          <br />
          But thanks to React Query, once those items have been added to the
          cache, they will load instantly when selected.
          <br />
          <br />
          ðŸ’¡ Meaning zero load time!!
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">THANKS REACT QUERY!!</h3>
