        <h1>Fetching Data</h1>
        <h2>Query Hook</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">Let's open back up the TodoList component.</h3>
        <h3>
          To fetch data with react query, we use the
          <em class="lite-yllw">query hook</em>, which is defined in
          <em class="lite-yllw">@tanstack/react-query</em>...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/query-hook.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h2>queryKey</h2>
        <h3>
          So we call this hook and then give it a config obj that will end up
          with two propertys...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/use-query-obj.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          The first one is a our <em class="lite-yllw">queryKey</em>
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/query-key.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          The <em class="lite-yllw">queryKey</em> is just a unique identifier
          for the query.
          <br />
          <br />
          <em class="lite-grn">üí° It's used internally for caching.</em>
          <br />
          <br />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          So anytime we retrieve a piece of data from the backend, the data is
          stored in the cache, and will be accessible via this key.
        </h3>
        <h3>We set the key to an array of one, or more values.</h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          üí° The first value is often a string that identifies the type of data
          we want to store here.
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/key-string.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          We can also have more values, like maybe for storing completed
          todos...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/completed.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          We could also use an obj with completed set to true...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/completed-true.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h2>No right or wrong</h2>
        <h3 class="red">
          There is really no right or wrong when chosing a string or an object
          for the key value.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          How we want to structure the cache really depends on our application,
          and it's requirements.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          For now we want to stick to a single value...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/key-string.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          But later in this section we will look at some more complicated
          examples.
        </h3>
        <h2>Query Function</h2>
        <h3>The second property is the queryFn</h3>
        <h3>
          This is the function that we use to fetch the data from the backend...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/queryfn.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          This funciton should return a promise that either resolves the data,
          or throws an err.
          <br />
          <br />
          So we pass an arrow func...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/arrow.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          Then we use axios to fetch the data from the backend...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/axios.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          üí° Here we are using axios, but you can use the fetch api, or any HTTP
          librarys.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          React Query doesn't care how we fetch the data, it's only concerned
          with managing, and caching it.
        </h3>
        <h2>Storing the response</h2>
        <h3>So, the get method returns a response object.</h3>
        <h3 class="red">
          We don't want to store that whole response object, we want to store
          the actual data that we get from the backend.
          <br />
          <br />
          So, after get, we call then, and use the resonse to return res.data...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/then.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h2>Separate the logic</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">
          We can also implement this logic <em class="lite-yllw">outside</em> of
          our query...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/separate-logic.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h4>Take a look at the signature of our function...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/signature.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="orng">
          This function returns a promise of type <em class="blu">any</em>
        </h3>
        <h3 class="red">Typescript doesn't like any types.üò°</h3>
        <h3>We should be more specific and take advantage of Typescript.</h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          We want our function to return a promise of todo array.
          <br />
          <br />
          To achieve that, we use angle brackets when calling the get method to
          specify a generic type argument...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/todo-generic-type.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          Now if we look at the signature we see that it returns a Todo array...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/signature-again.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3>
          üí° So, at runtime, React Query will call this function, and when the
          promise is resolved we get an array of todos.
          <br />
          <br />
          Then that array is stored in the cache against the queryKey.
        </h3>
        <h2>the query object</h2>
        <h4>
          So we call the query hook and get back a query object that we store
          like this...
        </h4>
        <img
          src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/store-query-obj.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="grn">
          This query object has a bunch of
          <em class="lite-yllw">propertys</em> like
          <em class="lite-yllw">data, error, isLoading</em>, ect.
        </h3>
        <h3>We'll talk about them as we make it through this section.</h3>
        <h3>
          üëÅ‚Äçüó®For now, we are only interested in the data property. <br /><br />
          So we can destructure it right away and grab the data property...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/destruct-data.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h2>Quick Code Cleanup</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">
          With this implementation we no longer need the state vars for data and
          errs...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/dont-need-state-vars.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/state-gone.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          You can also remove the entire effect hook...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/remove-effect.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/effect-gone.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          We'll come back to the err handle later...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/save-err-handle-for-later.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h2>Rendering the data in markup</h2>
        <h3>
          So instead of mapping todos, we map the data...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/map-data.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          If you don't like the name 'data' you can change it like this...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/rename-data.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          Then we can use our custom name...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/use-todos-in-markup.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="red">
          We have an err saying todos is possibly undefined...
          <img
            src="../../../imgs/part-2/react-query/fetching-data/undefined-err.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          This is because the call to the backend could fail, in which case
          todos would be undefined.
          <br />
          <br />
          <em class="lite-yllw"
            >For fix we use optional chaining...

              alt=""
            />
          </em>
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">This is how we fetch data with React Query</h3>
        <h2>Benefits of this implementation</h2>
        <h3 class="orng">
          üí° We get a number of benefits with this implementation.
        </h3>
        <h4><em class="lite-yllw">Auto Retries:</em></h4>
        <h3>
          If the call to the server fails, React Query will retry a couple more
          times.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          This is something we can configure, and we will cover it in more
          detail later.
        </h3>
        <h4><em class="lite-yllw">Auto Refetch</em></h4>
        <h3>
          We can configure this query to auto refetch after an alotted amount of
          time.
        </h3>
        <h4><em class="lite-yllw">Caching</em></h4>
        <h3>
          The first time we fetch the data it is stored in the cache, and will
          be fresh for a certain period of time.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Then the next time we need the same piece of data, if it's still in
          the cache, we don't go to the server, we can rapidly retrieve it from
          the cache
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">So this is how we fetch data.</h3>
        <h3 class="grn">Next we will cover handling errors.</h3>
