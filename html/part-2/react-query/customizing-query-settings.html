        <h1>Customizing Query Settings</h1>
        <h2>Topic im talking about</h2>
        <h3>
          Our querys have a few default settings that work in most situations,
          but we can always customize them
          <em class="lite-yllw">per query</em> or
          <em class="lite-yllw">globally</em>.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">Open main.tsx</h3>
        <h3>
          On the line where we create a new QueryClient we can pass a
          configuration object...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/customizing-query-settings/config-obj.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          Here we set defaultOptions to an object...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/customizing-query-settings/default-options.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          And in this object we set queries to an object...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/customizing-query-settings/queries.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In the queries object we can override the default settings for our
          queries <em class="lite-yllw">globally</em>.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          The first setting we are going to look at is
          <em class="lite-yllw">retry</em>.
        </h3>
        <h2>retry</h2>
        <h4>Retry has a default value of 3...</h4>
        <img
          src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/customizing-query-settings/retry-default.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="grn">
          ðŸ’¡ This means if the query fails, React Query will retry 3 more time.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Let's see how this works by simulating an err when fetching the
          todos...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/customizing-query-settings/simulate-err.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          Now if you look at the network tab in the browser devtool, you will
          see the initial request, and 3 more retrys...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/customizing-query-settings/retrys.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h2>cacheTime</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">
          The next setting we are going to look at is cacheTime.
        </h3>
        <h4>It has a default value of 300,000 or 5mins...</h4>
        <img
          src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/customizing-query-settings/cachetime-default.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          <div class="centerer" style="font-size: 24px">ðŸ’¡</div>
          <br />
          This means, if the query has no observer, then the query is considered
          <em class="red">inactive</em>.
          <br />
          <br />
          And after 5 mins the inactive query is removed from the cache.
          <br />
          <br />
          <em class="lite-yllw">This is called garbage collection.</em>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          The default value makes sense for most applications, but you can
          always change it to meet requirements.
        </h3>
        <h2>StaleTime</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">The next setting we will look at is staleTime.</h3>
        <h3>This specifys how long the data is considered fresh.</h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          The default value for staleTime is 0, which means that the moment we
          get a piece of data it is treated as old.
          <br />
          <br />
          So, the next time we need the same piece of data, React Query will
          refetch fresh data from the backend.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          To simulate this chage it to 10 seconds...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/customizing-query-settings/new-staletime.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          We have a green box indicating that our todos are fresh.
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/customizing-query-settings/indicating-fresh.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          But after 10 seconds they become stale...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/customizing-query-settings/indeicaitng-stale.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          The number you see represents the number of observers.
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/customizing-query-settings/stale-count.png"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3>
          One of the wonderful things about react query is that it automatically
          refeshes data under 3 conditions.
        </h3>
        <h4>Will auto refresh when...</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">When the network is reconnected</em></li>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">When a component is mounted </em></li>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">When the window is refocused</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Each of these have a config property...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/customizing-query-settings/refetch-settings.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h2>How refetching works</h2>
        <h4>This is the process React Query takes when refetching data...</h4>
        <img
          src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/customizing-query-settings/react-query-refetch.gif"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="grn">
          So, most of the time we don't need to change these settings, because
          the default settings work good in most cases.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          ðŸ’¡ The only setting that we customize often is the staleTime.
          <br />
          <br />
          And the staletime is dependant on the query.
          <br />
          <br />Some pieces of data get updated less frequently than others, so
          we should give them a higher staletime.
        </h3>
        <h2>Locally scoped query settings</h2>
        <h3>
          Moving forward we are not going to use global settings.
          <br />
          <br />
          So change all this...
          <img
            src="/imgs/part-2/react-query/customizing-query-settings/remove.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          To this...

            alt=""
          />
        </h3>

        <h3 class="grn">
          Instead, go the query hook in useTodos and define the settings here...
