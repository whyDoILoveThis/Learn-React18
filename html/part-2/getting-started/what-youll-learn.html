        <h1>What You'll Learn</h1>
        <h2>What exactly we will learn</h2>
        <h3>
          Now let's take a look at the way this course is designed and what
          exactly we will be learning.
        </h3>
        <h2>React Query</h2>
        <h3>In the first section we dive into React Query.</h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          React Query is a popular library for data management, and caching in
          React applications.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          With React Query, you never have to use the effect hook to fetch data,
          take care of errs, and loading indicators.
        </h3>
        <h3>All those concepts are built into the library.</h3>
        <h4>We also get lots of other features like...</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">Caching</em></li>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">Automatic Retry</em></li>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">Automatic Refresh</em></li>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">Paginated Queries</em></li>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">Infinite Queries</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          By the end of this section we will add caching and infinite scrolling
          to our game hub project.
        </h3>
        <h2>Global state management</h2>
        <h3>
          In the second section we will cover global state management in react.
        </h3>
        <h4>
          We will cover basic tools for global state management in react....
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">Reducers</em></li>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">Context</em></li>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">Providers</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>We will also explore a popular state management library</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">Zustand</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What about redux??</h2>

          alt=""
        />
        <h3>Well, Redux needs a dedicated course.</h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          Furthermore, with the tools we have available in modern times, Redux
          is actually not neccessary.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          We will see some examples and cover this in more detail during this
          section.
        </h3>
        <h2>Routing with react router</h2>
        <h3>
          In the third section we will cover Routing with React Router, which
          enables us to create multi-page apps.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In this third section we enhance the game hub project with a page for
          showing game details.
        </h3>
        <h2>So.. what will I learn?</h2>
        <h3>
          After completing this course you should have a solid understanding of
          3 main concepts...
        </h3>
