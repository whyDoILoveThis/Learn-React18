        <h2>What we'll do</h2>
        <h3>
          Throughout the course we will enhance the game hub project that we
          built in the first part.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          We'll add chaching to dramatically improve the performance of our
          application.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          We'll also add infinite scrolling so that new games load as we scroll

        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          We will ALSO add a page for viewing details about a game
