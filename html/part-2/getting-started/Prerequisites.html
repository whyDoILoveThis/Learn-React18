        <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
        <h2>What you should know</h2>
        <h3>
          The first part of this course was for complete beginners, and convered
          the basics of react and Typescript.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In the first part we built a web app for discovering video games.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In this part we will add more functionality to that app, so it's ideal
          if you took the first part.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          If you didn't watch the first part then you should have a solid
          understanding of the following concepts....
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">Basics of Typescript</em></li>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">Building Components</em></li>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">Styling Components</em></li>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">Managing Component State</em></li>
          <li><em class="part-two-li">Calling Backend Services</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="orng">
          If you are not confident with any of these concepts, I highly
          encourage studying the first part before taking this one.
