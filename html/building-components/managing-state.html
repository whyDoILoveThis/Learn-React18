        <h1>Managing State</h1>
        <h2>Highlight Clicked Item</h2>
        <h3><b>Add a second bootstrap class called 'active'</b></h3>
        <h3>You should see all the items are now highlighted blue.</h3>
        <h3>But, we only want the one we clicked on.</h3>
        <h3>
          For that we need a var to keep track of the index of the selected
          item.
        </h3>
        <h2>The Index Var</h2>
        <h4>Create a var like this</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/managing-state/index-var.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>-1 makes it so that no item selected.</h3>
        <h2>Conditional Class</h2>
        <h3>Now, we need to write a condition for the active class.</h3>
        <h4>Start with this...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/managing-state/class-select-condition.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>Then add these...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/managing-state/class-select-condition-classes.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          This is a very simple way to add dynamic classes. There are more
          advanced techniques, but dont worry about them for now.
        </h3>
        <h2>onClick</h2>
        <h3>
          Delete the handleClick function, and remove the MouseEvent import.
        </h3>
        <h3>Then you can write an arrow function inside the onCLick like...</h3>

        <h3>It doesn't work. Why?</h3>
        <h2>Why It Doesn't Work</h2>
        <h4>This variable...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/managing-state/index-var.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>Is local to the function component.</h3>
        <h3>
          So, any part of react(like onClick) is unaware of it. It's like a
          little secret inside the component.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          To address this we need to tell react that this component has
          data(state) that may change overtime.
        </h3>
        <h3>For this we need a built in function in react called 'useState'</h3>
        <h2>useState</h2>
        <h4>This is considered a 'hook'</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/managing-state/useState.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>
          A hook is a function that lets us use built in features of react. We
          will learn about more hooks throughout this course.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          With the useState hook we can tell react that we have data that is
          going to change state.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          The state hook returns an array with the first index being a var, and
          the second being an updater function.
        </h3>
        <h2>Using 'useState'</h2>
        <h3>
          The parameter of useState initializes the var, and the param of the
          updater function updates the var.
        </h3>
        <h4>So, with this...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/managing-state/the-hook.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>We can update our component dynamically.</h3>
        <h3>Be sure to delete the selectedIndex var from earlier.</h3>
        <h2>Finally</h2>
        <h4>Use the hook in onClick...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/managing-state/final-onClick.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>
          It's important to remeber that each component holds it's own state.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          So, if we added another ListGroup to our app they would work
          independently.
        </h3>
