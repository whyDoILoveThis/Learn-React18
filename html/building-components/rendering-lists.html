        <h1>Rendering Lists</h1>
        <h2>The List we created is useless</h2>
        <h3>
          We have hard coded the list items. What if we want them dynamically
          generated?
        </h3>
        <h4>Create an array of strings.</h4>

        <h3>We can't use for loops in JSX so we say...</h3>
        <img src="../../imgs/rendering-lists/arr-map.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>Dont forget the braces around your variable. {}</h3>
        <h2>Replace the list items</h2>
        <h3>The entire expression needs to be wrapped in braces here.</h3>

        <h3>We haven't added our css classes yet, but we'll get to it.</h3>
        <h2>key={}</h2>
        <h3>You should notice a warning about key something something</h3>
        <h3>This is because we have not added the key prop(property)</h3>
        <h3 class="undrln">React needs this to keep track of our items.</h3>
        <h3>
          So when we update the page react knows what part of the page to
          update.
        </h3>

        <h2>You Should Know...</h2>
        <h3>
          When rendering lists using the map method, you should give each item a
          unique key.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In our case each item is a unique string so we used the item itself,
          but in a real app where we retrieve items from an API, quite often
          each item has a property like 'id'.
        </h3>
        <h2>Finally</h2>
        <h3>
          Head back to the browser and refresh to get rid of console errs,
          everything should be fix.
        </h3>
