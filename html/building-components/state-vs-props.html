        <h1>State vs Props</h1>
        <h2>Compare and Contrast</h2>
        <img src="../../imgs/state-vs-props/compare-and-contrast.PNG" alt="" />
        <h2>Important note about Props</h2>
        <h3>Props should be treated as immutable.</h3>
        <h4>In English, this means...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/state-vs-props/immutable.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>
          So when we say something is immutable it cannot be changed. It's
          read-only.
        </h3>
        <h2>For Example</h2>
        <h4>We have the props to our ListGroup...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/state-vs-props/List-group.PNG" alt="" />
        <h4 class="red">We should not do this...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/state-vs-props/should-not-do.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>
          We wont get errs, and it will work, but never do this. It goes against
          the fundamental principals of React. Props should be treated as
          constants. NEVER CHANGING!
        </h3>
        <h3>
          You will understand the principals behind this as we go through the
          course.
        </h3>
        <h3>It is based on functional programming principals.</h3>
        <h2>State on the other hand</h2>
        <h3>
          State is mutable, and thats the whole purpose of using state
          variables.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We want to tell React that a component will have data that is going to
          change.
        </h3>
        <h2>One thing they both have in common</h2>
        <h3>
          Any time that either of them change, React will re-render the
          component, and update the DOM.
        </h3>
        <h2>This has been the compare and constrast</h2>
