        <h1>Passing Data Via Props</h1>
        <h2>Why we need props</h2>
        <h4>So, we've got a list of cities.</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/passing-data-via-props/city-list.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>But, what if we had names or colors?</h3>
        <h3>
          We don't want to completely remake this component for each kind of
          list.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We want to make this component reuseable. This is where we use
          propertys(props).
        </h3>
        <h2>What are props</h2>
        <h3>Props are the inputs to our components.</h3>
        <h3>
          It's like we are creating our own custom html attributes for our
          custom components.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We kind of make a spot ready for a variable to be inserted, and the
          value of that variable is used as the data of the component to be
          displayed.
        </h3>
        <h2>What we want</h2>
        <h3>Instead of defining our items here like this...</h3>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/passing-data-via-props/instead-of-this.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>We should be able to pass it as an input to our component.</h3>
        <h3>Kind of like passing a parameter to a function.</h3>
        <h3>We want to do the same for our heading.</h3>
        <h2>Typescript Interface</h2>
        <h3>
          We need to decide the shape of the inputs to our ListGroup component.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We are going to want to be able to pass an object with 2 propertys.
        </h3>
        <h3>'items', which is an array, and 'heading', which is a string.</h3>
        <h3>
          To do that we use a Typescript feature called an 'interface'. With
          this we can define the 'shape' or the 'interface' of an object.
        </h3>
        <img src="../../imgs/passing-data-via-props/the-interface.PNG" alt="" />
        <h4>Then we need this parameter</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/passing-data-via-props/component-params.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h2>Typescript err</h2>
        <h3>Now, in the App component, we have an err.</h3>
        <h4>Letting us know we haven't added the props...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/passing-data-via-props/typescript-err.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>This is another benefit of Typescript.</h3>
        <h2>App props</h2>
        <h3>
          Now we want to move the items array to App, and add our props just
          like html attributes.
        </h3>
        <img src="../../imgs/passing-data-via-props/app.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>We just wrote in the heading, but you could use a var too.</h3>
        <h2>ListGroup err</h2>
        <h3>
          Now, we have problem here because we no longer have the items array in
          here.
        </h3>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/passing-data-via-props/ListGroup-problem.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>We could prefix it like this...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/passing-data-via-props/prefix.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>But, this is duplicated and ugly.</h3>
        <h3>
          The better solution is to destructure our parameter, and add them like
          this...
        </h3>
