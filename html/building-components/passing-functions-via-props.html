        <h1>Passing Functions Via Props</h1>
        <h2>Our List</h2>
        <h3>
          It looks pretty good, when we click an item it gets selected, but in a
          reeal app something should happen after an item is selected.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Maybe we want to filter a list of objects, or take the user to another
          page, but something should happen.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Every app is different so we dont want to implement that logic in the
          ListGroup. We want it to remain re-useable.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          So, we need a mechanisim to notify the consumer(parent) of this
          component that an item is selected.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          The parent is the App, so when an item is selected we should notify
          the App component.
        </h3>
        <h2>Noting the selection</h2>
        <h3>
          Currently we have 2 propertys, and we are using these to pass data to
          our ListGroup.
        </h3>

        />
        <h3>
          We are going to add a 3rd property as a function, and call it down
          here...
        </h3>
        <img

          alt=""
        />
        <h3>With that our App will be notified. Let's make it work.</h3>
        <h2>The function signature</h2>
        <h3>
          Imagine that we want a function that takes a parameter called 'item'
          of type string, and returns void.
        </h3>
        <h4>So lets add the prop.</h4>
        <h3>
          By convention we start the word 'on'. So, 'onSelectItem'. The type of
          the prop is a function that has a parameter of type string, and
          returns void.
        </h3>
        <img

          alt=""
        />
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <h4>Use this to see all errs...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/passing-functions-via-props/problems-tab.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <img
          src="../../imgs/passing-functions-via-props/problems-terminal.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          It's an err we should be familiar with. It's telling us we have not
          yet added a prop that it's expecting.
        </h3>
        <h3>Thanks Typescript!!</h3>
        <h2>Adding the function</h2>
        <h3>
          Now, we can write a function directly in the prop just like onClick..
        </h3>
        <h3>OR, we could write a separate handler, which is preferred.</h3>
        <img src="../../imgs/passing-functions-via-props/handler.PNG" alt="" />
        <h4>Then add the prop...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/passing-functions-via-props/add-prop-to-component.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h2>Finally</h2>
        <h3>When destructuring the props we have to add our new one.</h3>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/passing-functions-via-props/desrtucture.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>Then add the function to onClick</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/passing-functions-via-props/final.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>
          You should now see the name of the selected city printed to the
          console by the App component.
        </h3>
