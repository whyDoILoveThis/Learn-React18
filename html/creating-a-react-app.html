        <h1>Creating a React App</h1>
        <h2>2 options..</h2>
        <h3>
          When creating a new react app we have a choice between the official
          tool provided by react, or we can use Vite.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Vite is getting increasingly popular because its much faster and
          produces smaller bundle sizes.
        </h3>
        <h2>Creating with Vite</h2>
        <h4>In your terminal...</h4>
        <div class="code">
          <p><em class="orng">npm</em> create vite@latest</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Then...</h4>
        <h3>1. Vite will ask a yes or no question. Press 'y'</h3>
        <h3>2. After that, you will need to name your project.</h3>
        <h3>3. Nex, you select your framework. (of course react this time)</h3>
        <h3>
          4. Finally, select the language you will use. We are using Typescript
          in this course.
        </h3>
        <h2>Final Steps</h2>
        <h3>Vite will tell you to run 3 commands.</h3>
        <h3>Run each of them one at a time.</h3>

        <h2>localhost</h2>
        <h3>
          You can now use this localhost server just like we always have with
          live server extension.
        </h3>
        <h3>It will refresh the page upon save and everything!</h3>
