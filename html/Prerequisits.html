          Understand that Typescript is a superset of JS that adds static typing
          to the language.

                <b>TypeScript</b> is a statically typed superset of JavaScript,
                which means it builds upon JavaScript by adding static typing
                features. Here's a breakdown of what TypeScript is and why you
                might want to use it:
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>1. Static Typing:</b> TypeScript introduces the concept of
                static typing, which means you can specify the data types of
                variables and function parameters in your code. This allows the
                TypeScript compiler to catch type-related errors during
                development, before the code is executed. This is in contrast to
                JavaScript, which is dynamically typed, meaning data types are
                determined at runtime.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>2. Type Annotations:</b> In TypeScript, you can explicitly
                annotate variables, function parameters, and return types with
                their expected data types. For example: typescript Copy code
              </p>
              <div class="code code--js">
                <p>
                  <em class="blu">let</em> <em class="red">name</em>:
                  <em class="orng">string</em> = "<em class="grn">John</em>";
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em class="blu">function</em> <em class="red">add</em>(x:
                  <em class="orng">number</em>, y:
                  <em class="orng">number</em>): <em class="orng">number</em> {
                </p>
                <p><em class="blu">return</em> y;</p>
                <p>}</p>
              </div>
              <p>
                <b>3. Code Quality and Safety</b>: Static typing provides
                several benefits:
                <br />
                <b><em class="undrln">Early Error Detection</em></b
                >: Type-related errors are caught at compile-time, reducing the
                chances of runtime errors.
                <br />
                <b> <em class="undrln">Code Documentation</em> </b>: Type
                annotations serve as documentation for your code, making it
                easier for developers to understand how to use functions and
                variables. <b><em class="undrln">Enhanced Tooling</em></b
                >: Editors and IDEs can provide intelligent code completion and
                better code analysis because they have information about data
                types.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>4. Enhanced Developer Experience:</b> TypeScript provides
                features like interfaces, enums, and advanced tooling for
                refactoring and code navigation. It enhances the development
                experience and productivity.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>5. Compatibility with JavaScript:</b> TypeScript is a
                superset of JavaScript, which means you can write and execute
                JavaScript code directly in TypeScript. You can gradually adopt
                TypeScript by adding type annotations to your existing
                JavaScript code.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>6. Community and Ecosystem:</b> TypeScript is widely adopted
                in the JavaScript community and has a large ecosystem of
                libraries and tools. Many modern web development frameworks and
                libraries, like Angular and React, provide TypeScript support.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>7. Compile to JavaScript:</b> TypeScript code is transpiled
                to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with all modern
                browsers and runtime environments.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Being a "statically typed" language means that, in TypeScript:
              </h4>
              <p>
                <b>Data Types are Known at Compile Time:</b> The data types of
                variables, function parameters, and return values are determined
                and checked at compile time. This is in contrast to dynamically
                typed languages like JavaScript, where types are resolved at
                runtime.
                <br />
                <b> Type Errors are Caught Early: </b> Static typing allows the
                TypeScript compiler to catch type-related errors during the
                development phase. For example, if you attempt to assign a
                string to a variable declared as a number, TypeScript will
                generate a compile-time error.
                <br />
                <b>Type Safety:</b>
                Statically typed languages aim to ensure type safety, reducing
                the risk of unexpected type-related errors that can occur in
                dynamically typed languages.
                <br />
                <br />
                In summary, TypeScript is a statically typed superset of
                JavaScript that offers improved code quality, early error
                detection, and enhanced tooling, making it a popular choice for
                web and application development, particularly in projects that
                require maintainability, scalability, and robustness.
