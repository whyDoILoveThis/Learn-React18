        <h1>Schema Based Validation with Zod</h1>
        <h2>Problem with our current validation implementation</h2>
        <h3>
          Currently we have validation rules right in the middle of our markup.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          As our form gets more complex we will end up with validation rules all
          over the place.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In that case its better to use something called schema based
          validation.
        </h3>
        <h2>Validation Libraries</h2>
        <h3>
          There are various validation libraries that allow us to define all of
          our validation rules in a single place.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">This single place is called a schema.</h3>
        <h4>Some popular schema libs...</h4>

          </li>
          <li>

              ><em class="ul-li">Yup</em></a

          <li>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://zod.dev/"
              ><em class="ul-li">Zod</em></a
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Zod is what we will use in this course, but you must understand that
          Zod is quite vast, so we will only learn the basics of how to
          integrate it with ract hook forms.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          If you want to go more in depth with the features of Zod, their
          documentation is well written.
        </h3>
        <h2>Install Zod</h2>
        <h4>The version I'm using now is...</h4>
        <div class="code">
          <p><em class="orng">npm</em> i zod@3.20.6</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Then import it to our form...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/import-zod.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          Using 'z' we can define the shape, or scheme of our form, and all its
          validation rules.
        </h3>
        <h2>Defining the Forms Scheme</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">Next, we use z to define the shape.</h3>
        <h4>So call z.object, and pass an object...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/z-object.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>The object will hold propertys that represent our form fields.</h3>
        <h4>Our name field is a string with a min of 3 chars...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/sting-method-clls.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          By chaining method calls like this, we can define all of our
          validation rules in a single place.
        </h3>
        <h4>Add a property for the age field as well...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/age-definition.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h2>Store the z object to a const</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">
          So we have called the object method, and passed a configuration object
          that represents the shape of our form.
        </h3>
        <h3>This returns an object that we store in a const schema.</h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          We could call it anything, but schema is a popular name.
        </h3>
        <h4>So, store it like this...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/const-schema.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h2>Address duplication</h2>
        <h3>
          Currently we have duplication, because we have defined the shape of
          the form twice...
        </h3>
        <h4>See, name and age are duplicated...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/dupication.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          Now, the great thing about Zod is that is has a method that allows us
          to extract a type from a schema object.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          That means that we don't have to write out the FormData interface by
          hand.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Instead, we remove the interface, and use z.infer to store the form
          data as a typescript type that defines the shape of our object.
        </h3>
        <h4>Like this...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/form-data-type.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>
          If you hover form data, you will see that it represents an object with
          2 propertys...
        </h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/form-data-hove.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>A typescript type is very similar to a typescript interface.</h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          So that was the first step. Using Zod we defined a schema for our
          form.
        </h3>
        <h3>Now we need to integrate react-hook-forms with Zod.</h3>
        <h2>Integrate react hook form with Zod</h2>
        <h3 class="orng">
          First, we need to install a library that includes resolvers for
          various schema-based validation libraries.
        </h3>
        <h3>It supports Zod, Joi, Yup, and many others.</h3>
        <h4>This is the command for the library we are using...</h4>
        <div class="code">
          <p><em class="orng">npm</em> i @hookform/resolvers@2.9.11</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Then importzodResolver...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/import-formhookzodthingabob.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h2>Using zodResolver</h2>
        <h3>
          Now when calling the form hook, we pass a configuration obj to its
          parameter.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Then we set resolver to the zodResolver function we imported, and set
          the param of zodResolver to our schema obj.
        </h3>
        <h4>Like this...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/useform-resolver.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="grn">
          We're almost there. The next step is to consolodate our error
          messages.
        </h3>
        <h2>Consolodate the error messages</h2>
        <h3 class="orng">
          First of all, you can remove the validation rules from the middle of
          our markup. We took care of that in the schema.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="red">
          Just make sure to still spread register and pass name.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Also we don't need separate messages in our markup for the errors.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Instead, what we do is just check for errors.name and if it exist we
          render a p with the bootstrap class 'text-danger', and inside the p we
          render errors.name.message
        </h3>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/errors-name.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>In a moment, we will write our err msgs in our schema.</h3>
        <h4>Do the same for age...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/errors-age.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>
          We haven't defined any err mesages, so we will get default ones from
          Zod.
        </h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/default-err.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="orng">
          If you don't like these messages, you can always customize them. So
          let's do that.
        </h3>
        <h2>Custom Err Msgs</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">
          When specifying our validation rules, we can pass an obj with a
          message property.
        </h3>
        <h4>Like this...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/custom.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          But what about the age? Why does the err msg say that it recieved a
          string?
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          The reason this is happening is that the value of input fields always
          return a string.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          To fix this we need to tell react hook form to interpret the value of
          the age input field as a number.
        </h3>
        <h4>
          So go to where we registered the age input, and pass this object
          property...
        </h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/valueasnumber-true.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>Now refresh the page and submit the form again.</h3>
        <h3>We get a different err saying it recieved 'nan'.</h3>
        <h3>We got that because the field was empty when we submitted it.</h3>
        <h4>To get a better msg back, we can define one here...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/age-err-msg.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          Now if we type a number smaller than 18 we get another ugly err msg.
          Boo.
        </h3>
        <h4>This is much better...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/schema-based-validation-with-zod/min-age-err.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="grn">
          Great! Like I said before, there is much, much more to Zod. If you
          want to learn more head to the official documentation.
