        <h1>Schema Based Validation with Zod</h1>
        <h2>Problem with our current validation implementation</h2>
        <h3>
          Currently we have validation rules right in the middle of our markup.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          As our form gets more complex we will end up with validation rules all
          over the place.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In that case its better to use something called schema based
          validation.
        </h3>
        <h2>Validation Libraries</h2>
        <h3>
          There are various validation libraries that allow us to define all of
          our validation rules in a single place.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">This single place is called a schema.</h3>

        <h3>
          Zod is what we will use in this course, but you must understand that
          Zod is quite vast, so we will only learn the basics of how to
          integrate it with ract hook forms.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          If you want to go more in depth with the features of Zod, their
          documentation is well written.
        </h3>
        <h2>Install Zod</h2>
        <h4>The version I'm using now is...</h4>
        <div class="code">
          <p><em class="orng">npm</em> i zod@3.20.6</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Then import it to our form...</h4>

          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          Using 'z' we can define the shape, or scheme of our form, and all its
          validation rules.
        </h3>
        <h4>So call z.object, and pass an object...</h4>

          alt=""
        />
        <h3>The object will hold propertys that represent our form fields.</h3>
