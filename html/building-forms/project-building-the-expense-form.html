        <h2>Build the form</h2>
        <h3>
          In this component we are going to return a form with three fields.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We are going to put each field in a div with a bootstrap bottom
          margin.
        </h3>
        <h2>The description field</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">
          In the div will contain a label with a form-label class, and right
          next to that we have an input with a class of form-control.
        </h3>
        <h4>This is the emmet snip...</h4>

        <h4>And we get this...</h4>

        <h4>
          Then give the label a name, set the htmlFor, and give the input an
          id...

        <h2>The amount field</h2>
        <h3 class="orng">
          We want the second field to be identical, with the exception of the
          name, and we need to set the type of the input field to number.

        <h4>This is the emmet snip...</h4>

        <h2>The category field</h2>
        <h3>
          Now we do the same thing, but we don't need an input field, we need a
          select field.

        <h3>
          In this dropdown list, we want to have an empty option, and then after
          it we want all the categorys.

        <h2>Dynamic filter list</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">
          This is the point where I said that we would make our filter list
          dynamic.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          I said it back
          <a href="project-building-expense-filter.html#Addingoptions">here</a>
          in the course.
        </h3>
        <h4>So, earlier we hard coded these values...</h4>

        <h3>
          We dont want to duplicate this code in our form component, instead we
          want to define all our categorys in a single place, so we can reuse
          them in multiple components.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">Go to the App component.</h3>

          In a real application, we're going to retrieve the categories from the
          server, so there will be a different module involved for that kind of
          work. For now, don't worry about that.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We're just going to hard code the categorys in a single place to
          simulate data stored in a server.

        <h4>For the categorys const, just make an array of strings...</h4>

          We are going to use this same method in the ExpenseForm.
        </h3>

          So copy the categories.map that we just made and paste it after the
          empty option in the ExpenseForm

          Make sure to import categories at the top of ExpenseForm.

          After the third field, add a button with 2 bootstrap classes, and have

          Go to the App, and make a div with a bootstrap margin, then insert our

          Next we need to bring in react-hook-form and implement validation.
