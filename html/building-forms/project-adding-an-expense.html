        <h1>Adding an Expense</h1>
        <h2>Define the interface</h2>
        <h3>
          You should have already added the onSubmit attribute to the form.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Now we need to define the interface for what we pass to that
          attribute.
        </h3>
        <h4>
          onSubmit is a function that takes data as type ExpenseFormData and
          returns void...
        </h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/project-adding-an-expense/interface.PNG" alt="" />
        <h4>Then add the props to the param...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/project-adding-an-expense/props-add.PNG" alt="" />
        <h4>
          Finally, where we submit the form, instead of console.log, we delegate
          to onSubmit..
        </h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/project-adding-an-expense/handle.PNG" alt="" />
        <h2>ExpenseForm onSubmit</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">
          Now head back to the App component, and handle the onSubmit of the
          ExpenseForm.
        </h3>
        <h4>Just log the data for this moment...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/project-adding-an-expense/app-submit.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>
          This console log is just to make sure that everything works. Then, we
          will come back and add the data to the expenses array.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          Now if you fill out the form with valid data and submit it, you will
          see the data logged to the console.
        </h3>
        <h3>The final part is updating the state.</h3>
        <h2>Updating the state</h2>
        <h4>First, rename data to expense...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/project-adding-an-expense/rename-data.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>
          Then, instead of a console.log, call setExpenses and pass a new
          array...
        </h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/project-adding-an-expense/new-arr.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>
          The new array needs to have all the items in the existing array, and
          then add a new object to the array.
          <img src="../../imgs/project-adding-an-expense/new-obj.PNG" alt="" />

          In the new object we need to spread all the propertys of the existing
          expense, and then add the id property.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-adding-an-expense/new-item-obj.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          In a real app the id is generated on the server, but we shouldn't
          worry about those complexitys for now
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">Great! We can add an expense!</h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          As one last step, we should clear the form when it's submitted.
        </h3>
        <h2>Clear the form on submition</h2>
        <h3>
          Back to where we declared the form hook, we want to grab the reset
          function.
          <img src="../../imgs/project-adding-an-expense/reset.PNG" alt="" />
          Now, instead of just calling for onSubmit, we pass an arrow function
          with the data...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-adding-an-expense/arrow-data.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          In that arrow function, we call onSubmit with the data, then reset the
          form.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-adding-an-expense/reset-form.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">Great! Congratulations for making it this far!</h3>

          This was alot and probably confusing af but you still had to have
          learned quite a bit.
