        <h1>Integrating with React Hook Form and Zod</h1>
        <h2>Import z from Zod</h2>
        <h3>
          The first thing we need to do is import z from zod, and call z.object
          to create the schema.
        </h3>
        <img

          alt=""
        />
        <h2>Apply some rules</h2>
        <h3>We have 3 inputs that we need to write rules for.</h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          Name and age are easy enough, but what about category?
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          The type for the category field isn't going to be a string or a
          number, it's going to be one of a set of values.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          So it could be groceries, utilities, or entertainment, but nothing
          else.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          To achieve that, we use a different type in zod called 'enum'. An enum
          can be one of many values.
        </h3>
        <h4>Now, enum expects an array of objects...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/array-of-obj.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          But we don't want to hard code them here, because we already created
          our categories.
        </h3>
        <h4>So we just pass our categories...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/dont-hard-code.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="red">
          We have an err on categories because zod expects the array we pass to
          enum to be constant, or read-only.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          But, why is this happening? We declared it as a const in the App! Boo!
        </h3>
        <h3 class="red">
          You must understand, that declaring as a const will prevent us from
          setting it to a new array...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/cont-no-change.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          BUT DOESN'T PREVENT THE USE OF ARRAY METHODS!
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/DOESNT-PREVENT-ARR-METH.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">That means this isn't actually a read-only array.</h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          To make this a read-only array, we have to append 'as const' to the
          end of it.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/as-const.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          This is just some Typescript magic. Dont worry if you are unfamiliar.
          You will pick up these techniques as you build more react and
          typescript projects.
        </h3>
        <h4>
          Now back in the ExpenseForm the err is gone, store the result in a
          const schema...
        </h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/const-schema.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>Next, use z.infer to create a Typescript type...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/typescript-type.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="grn">With that, we are ready to plug in react-hook-form.</h3>
        <h2>plug-in react hook form</h2>
        <h4>First we need to import useForm, and ZodResolver...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/import-useform.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          Now, in our component, we call the form hook, and in angle brackets we
          specify the type of the form data.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/useform-type.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          When we call this we pass a config obj, and set the resolver to
          zodResolver, and pass zodResolver the schema obj we just created.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/pass-schema.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          This returns an obj that we destructure to grab register,
          handleSubmit, and formstate. Then we destructure formState to grab the
          errors obj.

        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          You can find where we introduced the register function in this course

        <h2>Register the inputs</h2>
        <h3>The next step is to register each input.</h3>
        <h4>
          So we call register, pass the input name, and spread the result...
        </h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/register-input.PNG"

        <h4>Do the same for the ammount and the select category...</h4>

          alt=""

        <h3 class="grn">
          Great! We have registered our fields. The next step is to add
          validation messages.
        </h3>
        <h2>Add validation messages</h2>
        <h3>For this we need to dynamically render a 'p' after each input.</h3>
        <h3>
          So if we have a property called 'description' in the errors object,
          then we want to render a 'p' with the class of text danger.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/text-danger.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          In the p we want to render the error.description.message
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/p-render-msg.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          Copy and paste this line after the other 2 inputs, and dont forget to
          change the name.
        </h3>
        <h2 class="red">The ERROR</h2>
        <h4 class="red">At this point, we get this err in the browser...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/err-in-browser.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="orng">
          This err is coming from where we created the schema, and set the enum
          to categories.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="red">
          The reason this is happening, is because in the App component we have
          imported the ExpenseForm before we created the categories array.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/the-reseon.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          This means, while we are trying to create the schema, categories is
          uninitialized.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          To fix this issue, we need to go to the App component, and move the
          categories to it's own importable module.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          Then we make sure our modules are imported in the right order.
        </h3>
        <h2>Fix the error</h2>
        <h3>
          The first thing we do is create a file inside the expense-tracker
          folder, but outside of the components folder.
        </h3>
        <h4>We don't use tsx because this is just a data file...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/categories-ts.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>
          Next we remove the categories from the app, and place them here...
        </h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/move-the-categories.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>
          We don't want to use a named export either, so just export categories
          as default...
        </h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/export-default.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="grn">
          Now we import categories to the App
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/import-to-app.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          And the ExpenseForm...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/import-to-tracker.PNG"
            alt=""

          And the ExpenseFilter...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/import-to-filter.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          So now we are not dependent on the order of components being created.
        </h3>
        <h2>Form submition</h2>
        <h3>Now we need to handle form submission.</h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          So back to the ExpenseForm component, go to the form element.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In the form element, we need to set the onSubmit to the handleSubmit
          function that we got from the form hook.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/handle-submit.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          Then we pass handleSubmit an arrow function. That function will get
          executed if the form is valid.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/log-data.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">Now, go ahead and test our validation.</h3>
        <h3>
          If everything is working, then we just need to customize the messages.
        </h3>
        <h2>Customize err msgs</h2>

        <h4>
          Back to the schema, add an object to where we defined the min length,
          and set the message...
        </h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/descr-msg.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          The err for the ammount has that issue where it recieved a string.
        </h3>
        <h4>
          To fix this, go to where we registered the amount field, and set
          'valueAsNumber' to true...
        </h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/amount-fix.PNG"

          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="grn">
          The err msg for the category is also ugly, and customizing it is
          tricky. Let me show you.
          <br />
          <br />
          First we pass an object...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/pass-obj.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          In this object we set 'errorMap' to a function...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/err-map.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          And have the function return an object holding the message...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/project-integrating-with-react-hook-form-and-zod/fial.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="red">
          I know this is a little bit tricky, don't bother trying to memorize
          this, it varies from one application to the next.
          <br />
          <br />
          The thing to take away from this is understanding the big picture.
        </h3>
        <h3>The final part is handling the form submission.</h3>
        <h3>
          So if the form is submitted properly, then we need to notify the app
          component, so that the app component adds the new expense to the list.
