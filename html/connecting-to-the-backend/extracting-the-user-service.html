        <h1>Extracting the User Service</h1>
        <h2>The Next problem</h2>
        <h3>
          The next problem with our code is that the app component is too
          concerned with making http requests.
        </h3>
        <h4>For example, it knows about the abort controller...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/knos-about-abort-controller.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          The abort controller is purely about http, it cancels an http request.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Our component also knows about the request methods like get, post,
          patch, and delete.
        </h3>
        <h4>It also knows about our endpoint...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/endpont-it-know.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="orng">
          The endpoint is also repeated many times in this component.
        </h3>
        <h2>Analogy</h2>
        <h3>
          All these issues has our component acting like a chef whos only job is
          to cook, but we have him buying groceries and taking orders too.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          The app component should only do it's job which is rendering markup
          and handling high level user interactions.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          To improve our code, we should extract all the logic concerning http
          requests into a separate service.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          ðŸ’¡This allows us to separate concers and make our code more modular
          and reusable.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Potentially we could reuse the same service in another component. If
          somewhere else we need to fetch the list of users, we can reuse our
          service.
        </h3>
        <h2>user service</h2>
        <h4>First, create this file...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/user-service.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>In the file, import our apiClient...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/import-api-client.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>Then, create a class called UserService...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/class-user-service.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          In that class we will have methods for getting the users, creating a
          user, updating a user and deleting a user.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          Finally, we are going to export a new instance of this class as a
          default object.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/default-export-user.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h4>
          Now in the UserService class we create a method called getAllUsers
        </h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/getallusers.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          In this method we are going to have the logic for sending an http
          request to our backend.
          <br />
          <br />
          First, we take away this line where we defined the controller in the
          app...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/const-controller.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          and paste it here...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/pase-controller.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          We also need to grab this bit of code...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/grab-this.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          and paste that one here as well...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/paste-the-get.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          Here we have to have access to the User interface.
          <br /><br />
          The proper place to have this interface is in this user-services file,
          because this is where we have all the functionality for working with
          users.
          <br />
          <br />
          So we go back to the app component and grab the user interface then
          paste it in...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/interface-in-client-users.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          And since we are going to use this interface in our app component, we
          need to export the interface from this module...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/export-interface.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          Good the err is gone.
          <br />
          <br />
          Now when we send this get request it returns a promise.
          <br />
          <br />
          We can return this promis right away...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/return-the-promise.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          With that we can go back to the app component, and import the User...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/import-users.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          And from the same module import the userService...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/import-userservice.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          Next, instead of calling apiClient, call userService...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/userserviceinstead.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          Then replace the get with getAllUsers...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/gobledegoop.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          So we dont have to worry about passing a signal, we simply tell the
          service, 'give me all the users.'
          <br />
          <br />
          This returns a promise, so just like before .then we setUsers and
          setLoading...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/getthenwhate.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="red">ðŸ—¯But now we have a tiny problem. Ahhh!</h3>
        <h2>Accessing the controller object</h2>
        <h3>
          In our implementation we need access to the controller object...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/the-controller-object.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          This controller is purely about making http request.
          <br />
          <br />
          We don't want to export this from our user-service module because it's
          part of the implementation detail.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          ðŸ”®As a metaphor, think of a remote control, a remote has a complex
          logic board on the inside, but as a user we don't have to be worried
          about that complexity.
          <br />
          <br />
          We simply work with the buttons on the outside. Those buttons hide the
          implementation detail.
        </h3>

        <h3 class="red">
          So to solve the compilation issue, instead of returning this promise
          right away like this...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/instead-of-this.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We should store it in an object called request, and at the end return
          an object with two propertys...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/returncontrollerabort.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          So the consumer of the UserService simply uses the cancel method, or
          the cancel button, to cancel a request. How it happens internally is
          irrelevant.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thats implementation detail.
        </h3>
        <h2>Another problem</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">Back to the app component.</h3>
        <h4>We need to make a small change here...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/smalllchange.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>
          We destructure userService.getAllUsers() and destructure the request
          and cancel.
        </h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/req-and-cancel-destruct.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>After that we call request.then...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/req-then.PNG" alt="" />
        Finally at the end, instead of calling controller.abort, we call
        cancel()...
        <img
          src="../../imgs/extracting-the-user-service/return-cancel.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="grn">
          With this change our effect hook knows nothing about making http
          request, so we have better sepparation of concerns.
        </h3>
        <h2>EXERCISE</h2>
        <h3>
          For an exercise, move the other logic around for making http requests
          into our user-service.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="red">
