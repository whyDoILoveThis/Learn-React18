        <h1>Understanding HTTP Requests</h1>
        <h2>Topic im talking about</h2>
        <h3>So we learned how to fetch data with axios.</h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          As a frontend developer it's important to understand what happens
          under the hood when you call the get method.
        </h3>
        <h2>What happens</h2>
        <h3>
          When we call the get method, axios sends an HTTP request to the
          server.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">HTTP is short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          This is just a protocol for transferring data over the Internet.
        </h3>
        <h3>It's the same protocol that powers the web.</h3>
        <h3>
          When we visit a website, our browser sends a request to the websites
          server asking for some content.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/understanding-http-requests/request-response.gif"
            alt=""
          />
          The server then responds with an HTTP response that contains some
          html, css, and other resources needed to display the website in our
          browser.
        </h3>
        <h2>HTTP request in action</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">
          Open your code from the last lesson and inspect the networks tab in
          the devtool.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We don't care about all those js files and stuff, just filter by
          Fetch/XHR...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/understanding-http-requests/filter-xhr.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          <em class="red"
            >We have 2 requests to the users endpoint because of strict
            mode.</em
          >
        </h3>
        <h3>
          The status of the endpoint is 200, which means successful.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/understanding-http-requests/stat-and-size-of-request.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          It also shows the size of the request, and the time it took to
          complete it.
        </h3>
        <h4>If you click on a request you see more details</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/understanding-http-requests/req-details.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="orng">
          In HTTP, every request has two sections.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/understanding-http-requests/req-res-head-and-body.gif "
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In the headers tab we have some general headers.
          <br />
          <br />
          You can see that the Request Method is set to GET. That is used for
          fetching data.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/understanding-http-requests/req-meth.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          Later in this section we will look at other req methods for creating,
          deleting, and updating data.
          <br />
          <br />
          Then you see the status code again, and the remote address which is
          the ip address of the target web server.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We also have response headers.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/understanding-http-requests/res-headers.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          These are the headers included in the response, for the most part you
          dont have to worry about them.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          And also we have request headers.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/understanding-http-requests/req-headers.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          You dont really have to worry about these either, when we need to
          we'll come back and talk about specific headers.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In the preview tab we can see the data that was returned from the
          server, properly formatted.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/understanding-http-requests/preview-tab.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In the response tab, we see the body of the response sent from the
          server, in plain text.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/understanding-http-requests/response-tab.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          So here we have an array of javascript objects.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">This has been an HTTP request in action.</h3>
