        <h1>Showing a Loading Indicator</h1>
        <h2>Topic im talking about</h2>
        <h3>
          Let's see how we can show a loading indicator while we are fetching
          data.
        </h3>
        <h4>First, use a boolean state var to store an isLoading state.</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/showing-a-loading-indicator/isloading.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>Then, right befor we call to the server, we say isLoading...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/showing-a-loading-indicator/isloading-true.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="orng">
          To set isLoading to false we cannot call it after entire get method,
          because if we did it would get immediately turned off due to the
          nature of the async operation.
        </h3>
        <h4>So instead we must call it like...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/showing-a-loading-indicator/her-we-go.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3>
          💡 The order of these functions doesn't matter because react applys
          all the changes, then renders the component.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">But now we have duplicated setLoading! Boo!</h3>
        <h2>the .finally method</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">
          The proper way to do this is in the .finally() method.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">💡 All promises have a finally method.</h3>
        <h3>
          In the finally method we can pass a callback, and this will always get
          executed when our promise is settled.
          <em class="red">Whether it's resolved, or rejected!</em>
          <br />
          <br />
          With that we can write the code only once...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/showing-a-loading-indicator/show-once.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="red">
          ❗❗❗❗❗🤯💥💣🧨
          <br />
          HOWEVER
          <br />
          This does NOT WORK WITH STRICT MODE turned on.
          <br />
          🧨💣💥🤯❗❗❗❗❗
          <br />
          There is no explanation to be found for this anywhere.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          So unfortunaltely for the developement stage, we have to duplicate
          isLoading.
        </h3>
        <h2>Rendering the loader</h2>
        <h4>So we render a bootstrap loader if isLoading is true...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/showing-a-loading-indicator/render-spinner.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="orng">
          We probably won't see the loader because it loads so fast on
          localhost, but we can throttle the connection in the network tab of
          the dev tool, and then we will see it with each refresh.
