        <h1>Cancelling a Fetch Request</h1>
        <h2>Topic im talking about</h2>
        <h3>Earlier we learned about effect clean up.</h3>
        <h3>
          We learned that sometimes we need to return a cleanup func from our
          effect.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          In this example we are sending an HTTP request to the server to fetch
          the users.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">What if the user navigates away from this page?</h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          We don't want to wait for the server to return the data, and then
          render it here.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          So as a best practice, when we fetch data in an effect, we should also
          provide a cleanup func for cancelling the fetch request incase the
          data is no longer needed.
        </h3>
        <h3>To do that we create an object called controller.</h3>
        <h2>cancelling a req with the Controller object</h2>
        <h4>Create the controller obj...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/cancelling-a-fetch-request/abortion.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>
          This is a built in class in modern browsers that allows us to abort
          async operations like, fetch req, dom manipulation, or any operation
          that might take time to complete.
        </h3>
        <h4>
          Now, when we call the get method, as a second arg we pass a config
          obj...
        </h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/cancelling-a-fetch-request/second-get-arg.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>In this object we set the signal property to controller.signal</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/cancelling-a-fetch-request/signal.PNG" alt="" />
        <h4>
          Finally, at the end, return our cleanup fuction, which is
          controller.abort()
        </h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/cancelling-a-fetch-request/return-abort.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="orng">
          Remove the x we added to the fetch url when simulating the err, so
          that we are not simulating an err anymore.
        </h3>
        <h2>Cancelled err</h2>
        <h4>We get this ugly cancelled err...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/cancelling-a-fetch-request/cancelled-err.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h4>To remove this add a condition to the catch block...</h4>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/cancelling-a-fetch-request/condition-catch-block.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h3 class="orng">CanceledError is part of the axios module.</h3>
        <h3 class="grn">Good so the err is gone.</h3>
        <h2>How strict mode affects this process</h2>
        <h3>Now go to the network tab of the dev tool.</h3>
        <h3>
          You can see that we have 2 req sent to the users endpoint.
          <br />
          <br />
          The first request is canceled because as part of mounting this
          component for the second time, first removes the previous component,
          and that is like the user navigating away from the page.
          <br />
          <br />
          At that moment our cleanup function is called and our req is canceled.
          <br />
          <br />
          This is another benefit of strict mode in react. With strict mode
          enabled, we don't have to worry about a req being sent to the server
          twice.
