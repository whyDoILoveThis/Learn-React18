        <h1>Effect Dependencies</h1>
        <h3>
          So it has already been stressed that the useEffect runs a function
          AFTER the component is rendered.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          There are situations where we don't want this default behavior, and
          want more control over WHEN this function gets executed.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">Let's look at an example.</h3>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <h4>Add a new component to the project...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/new-file.PNG" alt="" />
        <h4>
          In this component we define a state var for the products, and init it
          to an empty arr...
        </h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/state.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>
          Here we use the effect hook to call the server and fetch the products.
          <br />
          <br />
          So we pass a function to the effect hook...
          <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/use-eff.PNG" alt="" />
          <em class="red"
            >We refer to this as a callback function, because react is going to
            call this function back.</em
          >
          <br />
          In this function is where we would fetch to the server, but we don't
          want to worry with that complexity for now.
          <br />
          <br />
          Instead, just console.log something...
          <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/console-log.PNG" alt="" />
          So, we fetch the products then update the products...
          <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/setproduct.PNG" alt="" />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="red">
          Now we have this err...
          <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/err.PNG" alt="" />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          The reason we see this err is because we initialized our state const
          to an empty array, so the Typescript compiler doesn't know what kind
          of objects we want to store in this array.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          Is it going to be strings, numbers, objects or what.
          <br />
          <br />
          That's when we specify the type of this constant in angle brackets
          here...
          <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/specify-type.PNG" alt="" />
        </h3>
        <h2>Test the example</h2>
        <h4>Now go to the app component and add the ProductList...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/product-to-app.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3 class="red">
          If you go look at the console, you will see it having a fricken
          seizure!!
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">It's stuck in an infinite loop!</h3>
        <h3>So remove the list from the app for now.</h3>
        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <h3 class="grn">
          So why is this happening?
          <br />
          <br />
          Well, we know that the effect hook is triggered AFTER each render.
          <br />
          <br />
          But we are updating the state in the effect hook, so that triggers a
          re-render.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/why-this-happens.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          So we get this infinite chain of update state, re-render, update
          state, re-render, update state, re-render.......
        </h3>
        <h2>The solution to the problem</h2>
        <h3>
          To solve this problem we should tell react to run this hook, only
          once, the first time this component is rendered.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">The effect hook has a second argument we can pass.</h3>
        <h3 class="orng">The second argument is optional.</h3>
        <h3>We can pass the effect hook an array of dependencies</h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          In this array we can pass one or more vars, that can be props or
          state, and our effect will be dependant on these values.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="red">
          ðŸ’¡ If any of those values change, react will re-render our effect.
          <br />
          <br />
          But, if we pass an empty array that means our effect is not dependant
          on any values, so it will be executed only once.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/optional-secont-empty.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
        </h3>
        <h3>
          To see this in action head back to the app component and add the
          ProductList back.
          <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/result.PNG" alt="" />
          We don't have the errs anymore!
          <br />
          <br />
          Do you remember why this component is rendered twice?
          <br />
          Recap on that
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="../../html/managing-component-state/understanding-the-strict-mode.html#WhatStrictModedoes"
            >here</a
          >
        </h3>
        <h2>Back to the example</h2>
        <h3>
          Now let's say we want a dropdown list for the user to select a
          category of products and then show those products.
        </h3>
        <h4>Add a select element with options in the App...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/select.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3 class="grn">
          Now we need to keep track of the selected category in a state var, so
          that when the state is changed our ProductList is re-rendered
        </h3>
        <h4>So create a state for the category...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/state-select.PNG" alt="" />
        <h4>Then handle the onChange of the select element...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/handel-change.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>
          Next we can check to see if it's working.
          <br />
          <br />
          So inspect with react dev tools...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/inspect-components.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          Now when you select a different category, you see the change updated
          in the state.
          <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/see-the-change.PNG" alt="" />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          Now we need to pass the selected category as a prop to the ProductList
          component.
        </h3>
        <h2>Pass selected category as prop</h2>
        <h3>
          So back in the ProductList component we should use an interface to
          define the shape of props.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">But, here we learn a shortcut!</h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          We don't have to explicitly define an interface everytime we need a
          prop.
        </h3>
        <h4>So we're used to seeing code like this...</h4>
        <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/used-to-this.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3 class="red">
          ðŸ¤¯ If we only have a single, or a max of 2 props, we can declare them
          inline here!
          <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/mind-blown.PNG" alt="" />
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          Now we can say 'fetching products in', category
          <img src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/fetching-in.PNG" alt="" />
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Now, back to the App we have to set the category to the selected
          category...
          <img
            src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/product-set-catedgory.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          If we test our app now, nothing happens. Why?
        </h3>
        <h3 class="orng">
          The reason this is happening is because of the empty array that we
          passed as a dependency to the effect hook.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/why-it-happenened.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          We told react that this effect is not dependant on any values, so
          react executed our effect only once.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="grn">
          To solve this bug in our application, we have to tell react that this
          effect should be dependant on the category prop.
          <img
            src="../../imgs/effect-dependencies/dependent-on-category.PNG"
            alt=""
          />
          So anytime the category changes, react should re-execute this effect.
        </h3>
        <h3>ðŸ’¡ For a more complex app, we could have multiple dependencys</h3>
        <h3>
          You should now see the category you select printed to the console.
        </h3>
        <h2>Recap</h2>
        <h3 class="orng">
          The second arg to the effect hook is the dependencies array.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <em class="red">NO SECOND ARG</em>
          <br />
          <br />
          If you do not supply the second arg, react will run the effect after
          every single render of the component.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <em class="red">EMPTY ARRAY AS SECOND ARG</em>
          <br />
          <br />
          If we pass an empty array, react will execute our effect only once,
          the FIRST time our component is rendered.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          <em class="red">VALUES IN THE ARRAY</em>
          <br />
          <br />
          If you add one or more values to the array, which can be props or
          state vars, react will run the effect anytime any of those values
          change.
