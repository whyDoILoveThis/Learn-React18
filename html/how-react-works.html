        <h1>How React Works</h1>
        <h2>Our componet tree</h2>
        <h3>
          Currently we have a componant tree like this, where the 'App' is the
          root and 'Message' is the child.
        </h3>

        <h2>When we start our app...</h2>
        <h3>
          React takes our component tree, and builds a Javascript
          data-structure, which is refered to as 'The Virtual DOM'
        </h3>
        <img src="../imgs/how-react-works/when-we-start-our-app.PNG" alt="" />
        <h2>The Virtual DOM</h2>
        <h3>
          This virtual dom is different than the actual DOM in the browser.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Virtual dom is a lightweight, in memory representation of our
          component tree, where each node represents a component and its
          propertys.
        </h3>
        <h2>Updating the DOM</h2>
        <h3>
          When the state, or the data of a component changes, react updates the
          corresponding node in the Virtual DOM to reflect the current state.
        </h3>
        <img src="../imgs/how-react-works/when-component-changes.png" alt="" />
        <h3>
          Then, it compares the current version of virtual dom with the previous
          version to identify which nodes should be updated.
        </h3>
        <h3>It will then update those nodes in the actual DOM.</h3>

          alt=""
        />
        <h2>React DOM</h2>
        <h3>
          Technically, updating the DOM isn't done by react itself, but instead
          by a companion library called 'react-dom'.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Earlier we saw in the 'package.json' file that we are dependant on 2
          libraries, 'react' and 'react-dom'.
        </h3>
        <h2>How <b>'react'</b> & <b>'react-dom'</b> work together</h2>
        <h3>
          In 'index.html' we've got the 'root div' and the script that runs
          'main.tsx'
        </h3>
        <img src="../imgs/how-react-works/root-div.PNG" alt="" />
        <img src="../imgs/how-react-works/main-script.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>
          In 'main.tsx' you can see that react dom is taking our root div and
          rendering there inside, our App component.
        </h3>
        <img src="../imgs/how-react-works/main-tsx.png" alt="" />
        <h3>
          The React.StrictMode component is just a built in react error catching
          feature. It doesn't have a visual representation.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We used ReactDOM to do this, but there is another library called
          ReactNative that will allow our app to render in a mobile app.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          So, React itself isn't tied to a particular platform, and we can you
          it to build apps for web, mobile, and desktop devices.
        </h3>
