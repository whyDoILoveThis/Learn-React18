        <h1>Separation of Concerns</h1>
        <h2>Important Design Principal in Software Engineering</h2>
        <h3>
          The principal states that we should divide a program into distinct
          sections where each section handles a specific functionality, rather
          that having everything in one place.
        </h3>
        <h2>The Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><em class="ul-li"> Modular </em></li>
          <li><em class="ul-li"> Easier to understand </em></li>
          <li><em class="ul-li"> Easier to maintain </em></li>
          <li><em class="ul-li"> Easier to modify </em></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Modularity also provides the ability to develope and test components
          independently.
        </h3>
        <h3>This makes it easy to use them again in another program.</h3>
        <h2>Modular Programs</h2>
        <h3>
          In modular programs each module is responsible for a separate concern.
        </h3>

        />
        <h3>Similar to how, in a workplace, each person has their own job.</h3>
        <h3>
          For example, the crane operator only operates the crane, and only the
          workers bolt in the steel.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          In a module all the complexity, and implementation detailes is hidden
          behind a well defined interface
        </h3>
        <img
          src="../../imgs/separation-of-concerns/well-defined-interface.PNG"
          alt=""
        />
        <h2>An analogy</h2>
        <h3>Think of the remote to a tv.</h3>
        <h3>
          The remote has a fair amount of complexity to it, but all that is
          hidden behind easy to use buttons.
        </h3>
        <h3>Those buttons represent the interface of the remote control.</h3>
        <h3>
          Building them with this approach will make our components easier to
          use in other programs.
        </h3>
        <h2>The disagreement</h2>
        <h3>
          Some people argue that CSS-in-JS violates the separation of concerns
          principal, because we put everything in the same file.
        </h3>
        <h3>But thats not the idea.</h3>
        <h3>
          Separation of concerns doesn't dictate whether everything should be in
          one file or multiple files.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Instead it emphasizes that different sections or modules in a program
          should handle specific functionalitys, and all the complexity around a
          specific funtionality is hidden behind a well defined interface.
        </h3>
        <h2>A practical example</h2>
        <h3>
          In our ListGroup component we have hidden the complexity by creating
          the props, like heading, items, onSelectItem.
        </h3>
        <img src="../../imgs/separation-of-concerns/example.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>The props are like the interface of a remote.</h3>
        <h3>
          It makes the component easy to implement, and re-use after being
          built.
        </h3>
