        <h1>What is React?</h1>
        <h3>
          React is a JS library used for making interactive and dynamic
          webpages.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          It was created by Facebook in 2011, and is the most widely used JS
          library for frontend development.
        </h3>
        <h2>Why was React created?</h2>
        <h3>
          As you know, when a webpage loads the browser takes the html code and
          cosntructs a tree like structure we call DOM.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          This allows us to use JS to change the page content based on user
          actions.
        </h3>
        <h4>for example...</h4>
        <div class="code code--js">
          <p>
            <em class="blu">const</em> btn =
            <em class="red">document</em>.querySelector('<em class="grn"
              >#btn</em
            >');
          </p>
          <p>
            btn.addEventListener('<em class="grn">click</em>',
            <em class="orng">() =></em> {
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="blu">const</em> div =
            <em class="red">document</em>.queryselector('<em class="grn"
              >#div</em
            >');
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;div.style.display = '<em class="grn"
              >none</em
            >';
          </p>
          <p>});</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Above we have hidden an element upon a button click.</h3>
        <h3>This is 'vanilla' or 'plain' JavaScript.</h3>
        <h2>With React, we dont have to do this anymore.</h2>
        <h3>
          Instead, we build componants in such a way that, in essence, we create
          our own html elements that have a complex structure.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Then, instead of mainipulating the DOM, we describe the state of our
          componants and react manipulates the DOM under the hood
        </h3>
        <h3>
          React components help us write reuseable, modular, better organized
          code.
        </h3>
        <h2>Imagine This Example</h2>
        <h3>We have a site for finding video games.</h3>

        <h3>We could make it out of components like this...</h3>
        <img src="../imgs/screenshot-exampls/react-components.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>You'll have components like this game card...</h3>
        <img src="../imgs/screenshot-exampls/card-inside-grid.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>
          Which are made of other components, and will be used in the
          construction of other components.
        </h3>

        <img src="../imgs/screenshot-exampls/componant-hierarchy.PNG" alt="" />
        <h3>
          In essence, a React application is a tree of componants, with the app
          being the root connecting everything together.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          We build components, make components out of those components, use
          those components that are made of components to make more complex
          components, then put everything together in the app component.
