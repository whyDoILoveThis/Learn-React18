        <h4>If you don't like this you could declare a local const var...</h4>

          But there is no need to create a state var to declare the full name.

        <h4>Picture this...</h4>
        <h3>
          Maybe we are going to call to the server to fetch data, and that might
          take time. While the user is waiting we want to display a loading
          animation, so we need to track the loading state.
        </h3>
        <h4>Let's say we have an isLoading state here...</h4>

        <h3>
          It's unrelated to the names, and theres a way to make this make more
          sense.
        </h3>
        <h4>
          We initialize the state variable to an object called person, with two
          propertys for the first and last name...

          Updating structures like this is difficult and we should prefer a flat
          structure.

        <h3>
          We want to group related vars inside an object, but avoid a deeply
          nested structure.
